YUI Compressor 2.1, 2007-0x-xx
------------------------------

+ Pass the --line-break option to the CSS compressor.
+ Allow the output file to overwrite the input file (with version 2.0,
  in this case, the output file was always empty)

YUI Compressor 2.0, 2007-08-27
------------------------------

+ Switched from Rhino 1.6R6 to Rhino 1.6R7
+ Integrated Isaac Schlueter's CSS compressor.
+ Refactored code to make it easier to use the compressor from a servlet
  environment or another Java app (no need to pass in file names anymore)
+ Output a white-space character after 'throw' only when necessary.
+ Output a white-space character after 'break' and 'continue' when followed
  by a label.

YUI Compressor 1.1, 2007-08-20
------------------------------

+ Java source now in package com.yahoo.platform.yui.compressor
+ Added --line-break option that adds a line feed character after each
  semi-colon character (may help debugging with the MS Script debugger)
+ Added support for missing JavaScript features (get, set, const)
+ Do not show the entire stack trace when the input file cannot be found.
+ Removed the randomization of obfuscated symbols. When compressed code is
  checked in CVS, unchanged files would otherwise end up being versioned.
+ Added web-based front-end to the YUI Compressor as part of the dist package.
+ Added a public entry point that makes the YUI Compressor easy to integrate
  with an already existing Java application.
+ Simplified code by using the same parsing routines used to build the symbol
  tree while looking for undeclared symbols.
+ Count how many times each identifier is used, and display a warning when an
  identifier seems to be unused (code cannot safely be removed automatically)
+ Remove ';' when followed by a '}'. This yields an additional ~1.5% savings
  on yahoo-dom-event.js compared to the JSMin version.
+ Output a white-space character after 'return' and 'case' only when necessary.
